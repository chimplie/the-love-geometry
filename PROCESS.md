Tests Assignment and it's Defence
=================================

The idea of tests assignment (TA) and it's defence is to create a situation that helps people to better express their
skills.

As in real world: in business or academia it is not just important to do something, but also to be able to take
responsibility for your actions.

The whole process is broken down into two parts: TA implementation and TA defence.

Implementation
--------------

During the implementation candidates work on the subset of presented tasks using whatever tools they require.
It's up to the candidate what to google, whom to ask or what solution to choose.

We welcome questions that may help you better understand what should be done within the assignment.
However, we must ask you to not abuse this opportunity: be clear, comprehensive and concise in your questions. It is
always better to collect all questions in a one concise list, instead of bombarding us with a series of requests.

Also, if you desire to make changes in the assignment in order to better express your skills - feel free to request such
changes. Minor changes do not require any approval.

Defence
-------

During the defence you are expected to show how the software works, explain how it is organized on the high level, pinpoint 
its core components and describe the idea behind their implementation. In addition to our interest to your code (it's clarity, 
readability, reusability) we are, above all, exciting about the way in which you make your decisions.

### Receiving Support

You must mention all significant sources of information you've used during the work on the assignment. You can ask for help 
from people with expertise in some domain as you usually do when you work on "real" tasks. We welcome collaboration and 
knowledge sharing but you MUST mention these people, their expertise, your question and how their answer helped you succeed. 
Also, in such cases you must explain what was your intellectual contribution to the solution. We may ask you to draft a 
solution to a similar or more general problem in order to understand how you learn from other expertise. 

### Feedback

We value your time spent on this assignment and are looking forward to hear feedback on our process and personally on your
opponent. Also, we think that ability to conclude and summarize, suggest improvement and explain gratitude is a valuable
skill for any person we would love to work with. So, pay attention not just to what we want from you but to what we are 
actually doing here.
