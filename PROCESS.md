Tests Assignment and it's Defence
=================================

The idea of tests assignment (TA) and it's defence is to create a situation that helps people to better express their
skills.

As in real world: in business or academia it is not just important to do something but also to be able to take
responsibility for your actions.

The whole process is broken down into two parts: TA implementation and TA defence.

Implementation
--------------

During the implementation the candidate works on the subset of presented tasks using all the tools he or she require.
It's up to the candidate what to google, whom to ask or what solution to choose.

We are welcome your questions that may help you to better understand what should be done within the assignment.
However, we must ask you to not abuse this opportunity: be clear, comprehensive and concise in your questions. It is
always better to collect all questions in a one concise list letter than to bombard with a series of requests.

Also if you desire to make change in the assignment in order to better express your skills feel free to request such
changes. At the same time, note that minor changes do not require any approvement.

Defence
-------

During the defence you are expected to show how the software works (we may ask you to help us to run it in case your
setup manual is complete), explain how the software is organized on the high level, pinpoint its core components and
describe the idea behind their implementation. In addition to our interest to your code: it's clarity, readability,
reusability we above all exciting about the way how you make your decisions.

### Receiving Support

You must mention all significant sources of information you've used during the working on the assignment. You can ask
for help from people with expertise in some domain as you usually do when you work on "real" tasks. We welcome
collaboration and knowledge sharing but you MUST to mention these people, their expertise, your question and how their
answer helped you to succeed. Also in such case you must to explain what was your intellectual contribution to the
solution. And we may ask you to draft a solution to the similar or more general problem in order to understand how you
learn from other expertise. 

### Feedback

We value your time spent on this assignment and looking forward to hear feedback on our process and personally on your
opponent. Also we think that ability to conclude and summarize, suggest improvement and explain gratitude is a valuable
skill for any person we would love to work with. So, pay attention not just what we want from you but what we are
actually doing here.
