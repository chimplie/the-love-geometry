Why Test Assignment Defence?
============================

The test assignment and their defence is in the heart of our recruitment policy. The reason why we shifted from the
quizzes to this form of candidate evaluation is that formal tests do not give one to express their skills and attitude
and therefore can not be a reliable source of information about candidate’s experience and level of interest in the
proposed position. Simply speaking, if quizzes are too simple they show nothing, if they are too complex they can be
either compromised (the person already knows an answer) or can put candidate into frustration preventing him or her to
exercise their craftsmanship.

We must emphasize that despite the fact that engineering is a complex and hard the modern approach (and the Chimplie
approach) lays in creating comfortable and open environment that forks for the people and where people receive support
and their competition is not reduced to a zero-sum game. That means that if we want to “battle-test” a candidate we have
to sandbox such environment. Which means that we do not put candidates under unnecessary stress but rather give him or
her opportunity to express: their skills, ingenuity, responsibility, respect to their temporary teammate (the defence
opponent).
