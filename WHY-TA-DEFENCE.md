Why Challenge & Defence?
============================

Challenges and their defence are in the heart of our recruitment process. 

We felt that the traditional interview tests / quizzes are not a reliable source of information about the candidate’s experience 
and level of interest in the proposed position; they do not provide an opportunity to properly express one's skills and 
attitude. Simply speaking, if quizzes are too simple - they show nothing; if they are too complex - they can be
either compromised (the person already knows the answer) or can put candidates into frustration preventing them from
exercising their craftsmanship.

We believe that despite the fact that engineering is a complex craft, the modern approach lays in creating a comfortable and 
open environment tailored for the individual, where the person receives support and where their competition is not reduced to 
a zero-sum game. If we want to “battle-test” a candidate, we have to sandbox such an environment. Not to put candidates under 
unnecessary stress, but rather give them an opportunity to express their skills, ingenuity, responsibility, and respect to 
their temporary teammate (the defence opponent).
